            <h1>History of the Furby&copy;</h1>
                <p>Dave Hampton and Caleb Chung spent nine months creating the Furby (in addition to nine months spent designing the toy). After two attempts at licensing the concept, they invited fellow toy and game inventor Richard C. Levy to join their efforts to sell Furby. Levy brought Furby to Tiger Electronics and Tiger's Roger Shiffman bought the rights to it. Furby's first public appearance was at the 1998 American International Toy Fair held in New York City.</p>
                <p>The product officially launched on October 2, 1998. Furbies originally retailed for about $35, and upon release, they sold very well. Catapulting demand during the 1998 Christmas period drove the resale price over $100, and sometimes as high as several hundred dollars. Furbies were sold for over $300 in newspapers and in auctions. Nicknames were given to the different aesthetic varieties, and sellers assigned rarity values to them. The significant aftermarket demand (and price) for the toy resulted in cases of fraud in which customers paid for Furbies that were never delivered. As supplies dwindled, and when retail supplies ran out, buyers turned to the Internet, where Furbies could be purchased for two, three, or more multiples of their retail price. During one 12-month period, a total of 27 million Furby toys were sold.</p>

            <h2>The Furbish&copy; Language</h2>
                <p>The original 1998 Furby and its dictionary contained a total of 42 different Furbish words. Following Furby models introduced a larger vocabulary.</p>
                <p>Furbish is formed from a mix of different sounds and syllables.</p>
                <p>Although Furbish may seem silly at first, it uses concepts, possibly inspired by many languages - especially Japanese and German. The Furbish word "Doo?" is used in place of a question mark and "Wah!" in place of an exclamation point. "Doo?" is very similar to the Japanese word "ですか?" which is also used in place of a question mark. (Example, Furbish: "Doo-dah oo-nye may-may kah doo?" English (literal): Do you love me?")</p>
                <p>A Furby starts off speaking predominantly Furbish, and slowly begins to speak more English/the language of the land over time. This is advertised as "learning to speak your language by talking to me", however a Furby will not learn words you expose to them. For example, a Furby won't start to say the word "pineapple" just because you repeat it to them. A 1998 Furby has four language development stages programmed that it will transition to the longer you interact with the Furby. Emoto-Tronic Furby, 2012 Furby and Furby Boom also work this way. Furby Connect and the 2023 Furby do not have developmental stages.</p>
